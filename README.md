# Study MyBatis

# Intro

MyBatis is a Java persistence framework that couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using an XML descriptor or annotations.

The former name of MyBatis is iBatis.

Unlike ORM frameworks, MyBatis does not map Java objects to database tables but Java methods to SQL statements.

It simplifies coding compared to JDBC. SQL statements are executed with a single line.
